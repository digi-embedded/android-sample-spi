SPI Sample Application
======================

This example demonstrates the usage of the SPI API by monitoring the
communication with a slave device. The application allows reading, writing and
transferring data to the slave device.

Demo requirements
-----------------

To run this example you need:

* A compatible development board to host the application.
* A USB connection between the board and the host PC in order to transfer and
  launch the application.
* An external SPI device is required to run this example. Another possibility
  is to short MISO and MOSI lines of the SPI interface so what is written in
  the SPI interface (MOSI line) is read (MISO line).

Demo setup
----------

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. The development board is powered on.
2. The board is connected directly to the PC by the micro USB cable.
3. If MISO and MOSI lines of the SPI interface are not shorted, an external SPI
   device must be connected to this interface.

Demo run
--------

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is to build and
launch the project.
  
Once application starts, configure all the SPI parameters (at the beginning
they are all set to their default values):

* **SPI interface**: All the possible interface and device combinations are
  listed to choose one. Changing this option during normal operation resets all
  the other parameters to their default values.
* **Clock polarity and phase**: Each of them can be set to `0` or `1` according
  to SPI standard definition.
* **Chip select**: Select the behaviour of the Chip select pin (or SS Slave
  Select) They are all individually selectable according to SPI standard
  definition. They might not be supported. If that is the case, the mode is
  discarded and the console displays a message.
* **Bit order**: The order in which the bits are transmitted and received.
* **Word length**: The size of each transfer word. Possible values are 7, 8,
  or 16.
* **Clock frequency**: The maximum transfer speed in Hz.
* **Read length**: The amount of transfer words to receive during read process.

The application shows two fields named **Data to send** and **Received data**
that correspond to the data to send to the slave device and the data received
from it, respectively. Three buttons take control of these operations:

* **Read data** button: Reads from the slave device the amount of words
  specified by the _Read length_ parameter and shows them in the
  _Received data_ field. If no data has been read, this field is empty. In case
  of error, the console displays a message.
* **Transfer data** button: Writes in the slave device the data introduced in
  the _Data to send_ field while, at the same time, reads from the slave device
  data with the same length as the written data. If no data has been read,
  this field is empty. In case of error, the console displays a message.
* **Write data** button: Writes in the slave device the data introduced in the
  _Data to send_ field. In case of error, the console displays a message.
